# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project README

This is my submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project as part of the Data Science Specialisation on Coursera. <p>

## This respository contains the following files:  <p>

1. **Codebook.md**: This is a codebook that describes the original data, the required transformations and the variables for the final dataset. <p>

2. **run_analysis.r**: Tidys the data with the following steps: <br>
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. <br>
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. <br>
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br>
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. <p>

3. **final_data.txt** The tidy data set <p>
4. **README.md** <p>
